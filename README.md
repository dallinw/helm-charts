# Helm Charts

Collection of helm charts used to showcase various features among my microservice demos. You can find the initial cluster configuration and setup inside the subsequent `setup` directory.

In addition, the platform is the main bulk of the config. With simply setting various technologies and features on and off, I can deploy ephemeral environments with the combination of services I need.

For more detail, please see the `platform` parent Helm chart.
